"Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-using-MNIST-Dataset"

implement a neural network using tensorflow and keras to classify handwritten numbers. Nueral network has two hidden layers with 128 neurons in each layers and the ReLU activation function use in hidden layer. Since this is a classification softmax activation function is used for output layer. Number of neurons in output layer equals number of possible outcomes. So there are 10 neurons in output layer.

Model has 94% accuracy.
